I'm Alicia Sedlock and I'm a front-end developer.</h1> <p>I love to build things for people. I focus a lot of energy into making sure what I build is accessible to everyone. I <strong>love</strong> web standards and CSS, and get excited about front-end architecture, CSS selector naming strategies, and performance. I can geek out about nitty gritty details about W3C specifications, as well as discuss the hollistics of a project's architecture. I also love people, and strive to ensure my peers and mentees are well supported and encouraged to grow.</p> <p>I am moving to San Francisco in June, and am currently looking for local opportunities. I'm looking for a new position that will allow me to have a critical role leading a front-end team, getting back to more mentorship and collaboration, and where I could potentially grow into an engineering manager.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Work Experience</h2> <h3>ThirdChannel // Software Engineer</h3> <h4>December 2016 - Present</h4> <ul> <li>Hired as the team's first front-end focused developer</li> <li>Currently leading efforts to stabilize our front-end ecosystem across several microservices</li> <li>Developing an internal design system, which includes standardizing how we approach HTML/CSS and React components</li> <li>Creating and maintaining features with React, Redux, Backbone, Rails, and Groovy</li> <li>Educating the development team on best practices for front-end development, such as an introduction to CSS Grid</li> <li>Creating low and high fidelity wireframes for new features, as well as presenting them to the product team for discussion and approval</li> </ul> <h3>Society of Grownups // Web Developer</h3> <h4>March 2015 - November 2016</h4> <ul> <li>Built an educational mobile web product using Ember and Elixir</li> <li>Lead efforts to improve accessibility and front-end performance societyofgrownups.com</li> <li>Created our first living style guide to eventually support all our digital products</li> <li>Mentored developers in the form of pair programming and internal technical talks</li> <li>Worked closely with Director of Engineering to create job descriptions, conduct phone screen and interviews, and identify hiring potential for the development team</li> <li>Documented internal best practices in the shape of coding style guides for CSS and Ember</li> <li>Wrote unit, integration, and acceptance tests for existing and new code with QUnit</li> <li>Collaborated with the QA and Product teams to establish acceptance criteria for JIRA stories/bugs/features</li> <li>Worked closely with product owners and designers to document requirements, prioritize features, and estimate work</li> <li>Participated in design reviews to disucss usability and accessibility concerns</li> </ul> <h3>Cantina // Senior User Experience Consultant</h3> <h4>December 2011 - March 2016</h4> <ul> <li>Created wireframes and interactive prototypes based on client requirements</li> <li>Developed cross-browser, cross-device, responsive web sites and applications</li> <li>Conducted sketching workshops and usability testing</li> <li>Interfaced with clients to establish project requirements and user stories</li> <li>Worked on-site with client development teams as an integrated resource</li> <li>Gained exposure to a variety of different technologies, such as Backbone, Angular, Ember, LESS/SASS, Node, Java, and a small amount of iOS/Android development</li> </ul> <h3>EF Tours // Web Developer</h3> <h4>October 2010 - November 2011</h4> <ul> <li>Leaded front-end development on EF’s global website, ef.com</li> <li>Created and maintained sites across several EF products using ASP.Net, VB.Net, and C#</li> <li>Implemented changes to the Sitecore CMS structure that supported several products</li> <li>Bug fixes and maintenance</li> </ul> <h3>Raytheon // Contractor</h3> <h4>May 2010 - October 2010</h4> <ul> <li>Performed an in-depth heuristic evaluation of government-grade software used for capturing and translating various media input</li> <li>Prototyped a customer-facing informational web site containing product FAQs and other information</li> <li>Executed QA scripts and reported bugs and functional issues</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h2>Speaking Engagements</h2> <p>Over the past two years I have been speaking at a range of front-end development conferences about the landscape and importance of front-end testing, making games in the browsers, and developer burnout.
