I'm Alicia Sedlock and I'm a front-end architect.</h1> <p>I love to build things for people. I focus a lot of energy into making sure what I build is accessible to everyone. I <strong>love</strong> web standards and CSS, and get excited about front-end architecture, CSS selector naming strategies, and performance. I can geek out about nitty gritty details about W3C specifications, as well as discuss the hollistics of a project's architecture. Boston is a massive hub in the web industry, which makes it a perfect home for me.</p> <p>I enjoy highly collaborative environments where I can get feedback and advice from peers, as well as lead technical discussions and implementations. Whether I'm pair programming, doing code reviews, or just spitballing potential solutions for a problem, I don't like to work in a silo. I care greatly for user experience and like to have insight or involvement in wireframing and other UX tasks.</p> </section> <section> <h2>Work Experience</h2> <h3>Society of Grownups // Web Developer</h3> <h4>March 2015 - Present</h4> <ul> <li>Building an educational mobile web product using Ember and Elixir</li> <li>Leading efforts to improve accessibility and front-end performance societyofgrownups.com</li> <li>Creating our first living style guide to eventually support all our digital products</li> <li>Mentoring developers in the form of pair programming and internal technical talks</li> <li>Documenting internal best practices in the shape of coding style guides for CSS and Ember</li> <li>Working closely with product owners and designers to document requirements, prioritize features, and estimate work</li> </ul> <h3>Cantina // Senior User Experience Consultant</h3> <h4>December 2011 - March 2016</h4> <ul> <li>Created wireframes and interactive prototypes based on client requirements</li> <li>Developed cross-browser, cross-device, responsive web sites and applications</li> <li>Conducted sketching workshops and usability testing</li> <li>Interfaced with clients to establish project requirements and user stories</li> <li>Worked on-site with client development teams as an integrated resource</li> </ul> <h3>EF Tours // Web Developer</h3> <h4>October 2010 - November 2011</h4> <ul> <li>Leaded front-end development on EFâ€™s global website, ef.com</li> <li>Created and maintained sites across several EF products using ASP.Net, VB.Net, and C#</li> <li>Implemented changes to the Sitecore CMS structure that supported several products</li> <li>Bug fixes and maintenance</li> </ul> <h3>Raytheon // Contractor</h3> <h4>May 2010 - October 2010</h4> <ul> <li>Performed an in-depth heuristic evaluation of government-grade software used for capturing and translating various media input</li> <li>Prototyped a customer-facing informational web site containing product FAQs and other information</li> <li>Executed QA scripts and reported bugs and functional issues</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h2>Speaking Engagements</h2> <p>Over the past two years I have been speaking at a range of front-end development conferences about the landscape and importance of front-end testing.
